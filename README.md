# Rwanda-Car-Import-Taxes-Calculator
This calculator can be used to estimate in RwFs and USD how much it will cost you to import an used car. 
The logic in this tool is based on the Rwanda tax reforms taking effect as of the 1st July 2025
The cars list and their prices as new are as published by Rwanda Revenue Authority (RRA); if a certain car is not on the list try a car model and specifications within the same price range.
Note: Definitive taxes to import a given car are determined by RRA.
